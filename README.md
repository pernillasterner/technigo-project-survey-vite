# Employee Engagement Survey:

This project uses React to make a survey multi-step form where users can answer different types of questions. After finishing the survey, users get a summary of their answers.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### Goals and steps

1. Display each question to the user, allowing them to answer one by one
2. Store the user's responses in the state as they answer each question
3. Once the user has answered all the questions, display a summery of their answers.
4. Provide recommendations based on their answers

### The Problem
